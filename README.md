# Soggy - Inferno of the cockroaches - SFML version

this is a simple recreation of my application for the Cologne Game Lab
the original project was done in Unity, this version is entirely in C++ and SFML

This is part of the Game Programming module assignment during my third semester at CGL
WT 2019-2020

To fix the dependencies in Visual Studio just download SFML 2.5.1 Visual C++ 15 32bit from sfml-dev.org
and place the unpacked folder in the soggy solution folder
